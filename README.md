# Audio-Modding-Template

This is a template UE project for audio modding. The assets are generated my 'GenerateAudioAssets' editor script inside of the _EditorBPs folder. The word list is generated by my [audio asset generation script](https://github.com/DRG-Modding/Useful-Scripts/blob/main/Asset%20Generator/get_audio_assets.py).

Use is as simple as opening the FSD.uproject!
