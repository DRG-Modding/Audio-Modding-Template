# Audio-Modding-Template

This is a template UE project for audio modding. The assets are generated my 'GenerateAudioAssets' editor script inside of the _EditorBPs folder. The word list is generated by my [audio asset generation script](https://github.com/DRG-Modding/Useful-Scripts/blob/main/Asset%20Generator/get_audio_assets.py).

Use is as simple as opening the FSD.uproject!

**Important:**
In File -> Package Project -> Package Settings -> Directories to never cook (if you can't see it, click the arrow dropdown), make sure that the _EditorBPs and SoundControl folders are in there. However, since the sound concurrencies are inside the root audio folder, you will need to manually delete these after you have packed (failure to delete them will cause the game to crash, or worse, screw up the game's audio).
