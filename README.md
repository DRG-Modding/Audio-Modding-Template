# Audio-Modding-Template

This is a template UE project for audio modding. The types of assets that are generated are:
1. Reverbs Effects
2. Sound Classes
3. Sub Mixes
4. Sound Mixes
5. Attenuation Groups
6. Sound Concurrencies

These assets are actually cooked assets imported directly into the editor, which means that they can *only* be used as references in your cues, and *cannot* be opened.

Use is as simple as opening the FSD.uproject!
